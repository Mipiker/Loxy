# Loxy

### This game reproduce electricity in 2D but in way more simpler like redstone in minecraft.
It has different tiles like wire, switch and logic OR, AND, XOR, INV gates.</br>
With all of this you can possibly recreate a computer or at least a processor.

If you want to test this game, you can download it in the release tab or compile it in eclipse (make sure to add all lwjgl jars and Isis jar in build path, their natives are in folder lib/lib/all_natives).
